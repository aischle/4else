# CLAUDE.md — 4else
## Persistent project instructions for Claude Code

Read this before changing code. It records what has already been decided.
If something is not covered here, ask before inventing.

**Before you touch git, read §8.** Commits to `main` are pre-authorised;
pushing and branching are not.

## 1. What this project is

**4else** (fourelse ag, Hüntwangen) is a Swiss event platform: organisers
design an event page, take registrations and collect payment in one flow.
**4else.com** organises (event pages, registration, participants);
**4else.one** takes the money (TWINT, card, invoice, PayPal, via Payrexx).

This repository is the public website. It starts with the start page, built
from the design `4else Startseite 02 - (standalone).html`
(`Z:\GoogleDrive\projects\4else\`). The design system sheet lives in the same
folder (`4else Design System Sheet.dc.html`).

## 2. Stack (mirrors temu.swiss)

The tech stack deliberately matches temu.swiss
(`D:\CloudStation\www\www-local\temu_SWISS`). When in doubt about a pattern,
look at how temu.swiss does it.

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18.3, TypeScript 5.5 (strict)
- **i18n:** next-intl v4, all routes under `app/[locale]/`
- **Styling:** CSS Modules on a token layer (`styles/tokens.css`); no CSS framework
- **Hosting:** Vercel, with `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights`
- **Lint:** `next/core-web-vitals`
- **Installed but not wired yet** (same as temu.swiss, ready when needed):
  `@sanity/client`, `@sanity/image-url`, `@portabletext/react`,
  `@supabase/supabase-js`, `next-themes`, `lucide-react`

Scripts:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server on **port 3007** |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run check:i18n` | Message-file integrity (§4) |
| `npm run build` | Production build |

**Build safety:** never run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running —
both write to `.next/` and corrupt it. Use `npm run typecheck` to verify
instead, or stop the dev server first and restart it afterwards.

## 3. Design system

- **Typeface: Instrument Sans**, weights 400/500/600/700, loaded with
  `next/font/google` in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` (self-hosted at build time,
  no runtime request to Google). Exposed as `--font`.
- **Tokens:** every colour, radius, shadow and layout width is a custom
  property in `styles/tokens.css`. Do not hardcode hex values in component CSS.
- **One accent:** `--accent` (#5B5BD6, violet). Pastel card grounds
  (`--lilac`, `--mint`, `--peach`) are surfaces, not accents.
- **Ground:** `--page` (#F7F6F2, warm off-white); ink `--ink` (#111111).
- **Buttons:** pills from `components/ui/Button.module.css` — `solid`,
  `outline`, and `inverse` / `ghostOnInk` for the dark CTA band.
- **Light only.** The design has no dark mode; `next-themes` is installed but
  not used.

---

## 4. Language and copy

- **All visible copy lives in `messages/*.json`** and is read with next-intl
  (`useTranslations` / `t.rich`). No UI string is hardcoded in JSX — that
  includes `alt`, `aria-label` and `placeholder`.
- **German is the default and the only authored language.** `lib/i18n.ts`
  declares `de`, `en`, `fr`, `it`; routes for the last three resolve but fall
  back to German until their message files exist. Add a language by creating
  its message file and adding it to `enabledLocales`.
- **URLs:** `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` — German is served bare (`/`), other
  locales get a prefix (`/en`). `localeDetection` is **off**, so an English
  browser is not redirected to an untranslated `/en`.
- **Register: `du`.** The design addresses organisers informally
  ("Dein Event", "du brauchst"). Keep it consistent.
- **Swiss orthography:** `ss`, never `ß` (enforced by `npm run check:i18n`).
- **Emphasis lives in the messages:** `<accent>` (violet) and `<b>` tags,
  rendered by `t.rich()` in the page, so a translation can place emphasis
  differently.
- **Internal links** use the typed `Link` from `lib/navigation.ts`, never
  `next/link`. Same-page anchors (`#tun`, `#warum`, `#ablauf`) are plain `<a>`.

`npm run check:i18n` treats `de.json` as the source: every other message file
must have the same keys, rich-text tags and ICU placeholders.

## 5. Start page

`app/[locale]/page.tsx`, sections in order: hero → statement → what we do
(three cards) → payment banner → why 4else → how it works → testimonials →
FAQ → dark CTA band → newsletter. Nav (`components/header`) and footer
(`components/footer`) come from the locale layout.

Things to know:

- **The hero is the mascot redesign** (handoff:
  `Z:\GoogleDrive\projects\4else\design_handoff_4else_homepage\`). A dark
  ground (`--hero-ground`) with two radial glows, the mascot left, and right
  the badge, headline, lead, two buttons and a glass sample ticket
  (`components/home/TicketCard.tsx`). The mascot's edges are feathered with a
  two-gradient CSS mask so the artwork has no rectangle. The ticket shows the
  design's fictional event (Reitkurs, Anna Müller, CHF 45.–) — sample data,
  like the testimonials.
- **The dark ground fades back to the page ground across the statement
  section** — one CSS gradient, no scroll JS. The hero is pulled up under the
  sticky nav (`margin-top: calc(var(--nav-h) * -1)`) so the dark ground runs
  behind the bar.
- **The nav mirrors the ground it is over.** `components/header/Header.tsx` is
  a client component. It watches three marks the statement section places down
  the fade (`components/header/navTheme.ts`, `.fadeStart/.fadeText/.fadeEnd` in
  `page.module.css`) and has three looks: dark glass over the hero, **no tint
  at all through the fade** — the blur alone reproduces the gradient, so there
  is nothing to mismatch — and the site's light glass once the fade is done.
  Its text switches from light to ink at the middle mark (31%), the only swap
  that shows; move that percentage if it reads early or late. A page without
  the marks, like the 404, keeps the light bar.
- **Placeholder destinations.** Pricing, About, Login, Demo, the card links,
  every CTA and the footer link columns point at `#` — the design has no
  targets yet. The footer e-mail and phone are real `mailto:`/`tel:` links.
- **Newsletter form is UI only** (`components/home/NewsletterForm.tsx`):
  submitting does nothing. Connect it to a list provider before launch.
- **Testimonials are the design's sample quotes.** Replace them with real,
  approved customer statements before going live.
- **FAQ** (`faq` namespace, `f1`–`f11`). Eleven pairs taken from the live site
  4else.events, verbatim apart from the `du` casing (§4) and one title
  rephrased as a question. The section follows temu.swiss: native
  `<details>`/`<summary>`, never a client-side accordion, so every answer sits
  in the server-rendered HTML whether the item is open or closed.
  `components/seo/FaqJsonLd.tsx` emits the `FAQPage` schema from the same
  message keys, so copy and structured data cannot drift. **To add or remove a
  pair, edit `FAQ_IDS` there and the `fNQuestion`/`fNAnswer` keys** — never
  hand-write the schema text. Note the transaction fee (4,8 % + CHF 0.20) and
  the payment methods are now stated both here and on 4else.events; keep them
  in step.
- **No mobile menu.** Like the design, the nav's section links hide below
  1000px; only the wordmark, Login and Demo remain.
- **Images** live in `public/images/home/` and render through `next/image`.
  `mascot.png` (1.3 MB) and `participant.png` (1.4 MB) are large at source;
  `next/image` serves them resized.

---

## 6. SEO

- Title and description come from `messages/*.json` (`meta` namespace) in the
  layout's `generateMetadata`.
- **Favicon:** `app/icon.png` (512px), `app/apple-icon.png` (180px) and
  `app/favicon.ico` (32px). Next.js picks these up by filename and emits the
  link tags itself — no `<head>` markup anywhere. The source is the mark from
  4else.events (`cropped-4e_violett.png`, white "4e" on violet). Its violet is
  `#60608B`, which is **not** the site's `--accent` (#5B5BD6); the apple icon
  is flattened onto that same violet because iOS renders transparency black.
- `app/robots.ts` and `app/sitemap.ts` build absolute URLs from
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (see `.env.example`), falling back to
  `http://localhost:3007`. **Set it in Vercel** once the production domain is
  chosen. The sitemap lists every route in `lib/routing.ts` automatically.

---

## 7. Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Never commit `.env.local`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Canonical origin for metadata, robots and sitemap |

## 8. Git — committing, pushing, branching

**Commit to `main` freely. Never push, and never branch, without Robin's
explicit order.**

- **Commit** — pre-authorised. Commit whenever the work warrants it.
- **Push** — gated. Stop after the commit and say what is waiting. Once
  Vercel is connected, a push to `main` deploys.
- **Branch** — gated. Work on `main` unless asked otherwise.

Remote: `https://github.com/aischle/4else.git`.
